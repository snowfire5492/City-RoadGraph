# City-RoadGraph

create a Directed Graph data structure that allows input of citys and roads and uses Djikstra's algorithm to find shortest
 path between two cities. Program also keeps track of the route taken on shortest path between cities. The program should be
 able to handle ANY incorrect input and let user know how to make corrections to input. The only way the program will be able to
 exit is if the user selects command 'e' .
